# Getting Started

**Welcome to the Zerrow !** Here you'll get an overview of all the amazing features Zerrow offers to provide you a one-stop financial service hub.

## Introduction

The zerrow protocol allows you to do two things with your 0g crypto tokens: lend them and borrow them. You lend your tokens to earn yield on them, and borrow tokens using the tokens you've lent as collateral. This feature suite is packaged into a user-friendly application called zerrow lend.

Remember: In order to borrow tokens through zerrow , you must first supply tokens to any of zerrow 's supported asset pools. This is because zerrow is an overcollateralized borrowing-lending protocol, meaning that you need to provide collateral worth more than the amount you intend to borrow.

This ensures the security and stability of the protocol by mitigating the risk of default. When you supply tokens, you are effectively contributing to the liquidity pool, making it possible for others to borrow and for you to earn yield on your supplied assets.

Zerrow currently consists five parts: Lend, stake, looper, portfolio, Ecosystem.

Lending is a new lending protocol with secure isolated liquidity.

Stake is earn extra yield and compound your returns in just a few clicks. Lend and borrow against your position, stay flexible, and engage with the best opportunities in DeFi.

Looper is leverage your deposits to maximize yield.

Portfolio is the place to manage your zerrow positions.

Ecosystem is the production applications, powered by zerrow .

The project passed audit reviews from Octane Security, and will continue to ensure the security of users' assets with the strictest security requirements.

The website for our protocol is zerrow.ai.
